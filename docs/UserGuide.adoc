== Introduction

Internship Diary is a desktop application that assists university students in managing their internship applications.

With the Internship Diary, you can leave behind your troubling times trying to to organize, track, and review all your past and upcoming internship applications.
The application is designed and optimized for users who can type quickly, and provides an elegant design which is easy on the eyes.

== Quick Start

Here are the steps to get you started on using Internship Diary:

. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
. Download the latest `internshipdiary.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Internship Diary.
. Double-click the file to start the app.
The Graphical User Interface (GUI) should appear in a few seconds.

=== Structure of interview
* `Interview` represents an interview that you have been given by the company you are applying to.
It exists within an `InternshipApplication`
* Currently there are two types of `Interview` provided by the Internship Diary:
** Online Interview -- No address is needed.
** Offline Interview -- Address must be provided when interview is added or modified from online to offline.
* You can specify what type of interview you want to add by using the `o/IS_ONLINE` prefix.
* In order to facilitate your tracking of interviews, there are no restriction to what `InternshipApplication`
you can add your interview to. +
Therefore, it is possible for you to add an interview to an `InternshipApplication` with any status.
** This is so that just in case you forgot to record an interview after you already got offered or rejected,
you could still add it into the Internship Diary for your personal tracking.
** In v2.0, we will create a prompt on whether you want to automatically change your `InternshipApplication` status
to 'interview'.

[%header,cols="1a, 1, 1, 1, 5"]
|===
|*Field* | *Prefix* | Can Be Empty? | Max Number of Values | Remarks
| isOnline | o/ | No | 1 | Can only be `true` or `false`
| Interview Date | d/ | No | 1 | Must be a valid date of the form `day-month-year`. Whitespace and `/` are also supported
separators. If year is not given, will default to the current year.
| Interview Address | a/ | online: yes offline: no | 1 | No restrictions on input.

// end::interviewStructure[]

=== Command format

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. +
(e.g. in `add n/COMPANY_NAME`, `COMPANY_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add c/Google`)
* Items in square brackets are optional. +
(e.g `c/COMPANY_NAME [w/PRIORITY]` can be used as `c/Google w/5` or as `c/Google`)
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times. +
(e.g. `delete INDEX, [INDEX],...` can be used as `delete 1` or `delete 1, 2, 3`)
* Parameters can be entered in any order. +
(e.g. if the command specifies `s/STATUS r/ROLE`, `r/designer s/applied` is also acceptable)
* An input consisting of only spaces is considered empty.

=== Viewing command history

Use the `up` and `down` arrow keys while the command box is being focused to scroll through your command history.

=== Other important information

==== Index of an internship application

* We will use `INDEX` to refer to a particular internship application.
** `INDEX` can be found on the left side of an internship application card.
** `INDEX` will start from **1** (inclusive).
** `INDEX` is not unique to a particular internship application -- it will change as the list is updated.
** `INDEX` only serves as a reference for you to choose the correct internship application.

.Example of an internship application card seen on the Internship Application List
image::sample_index.png[align="center", width="600"]

* For any command that uses `INDEX`:
** `INDEX` must be among those displayed in the current list.
*** For example, if the current list displays `INDEX` *1 to 10*, `INDEX` 11 will not be considered valid.

==== Multiple fields

* Commands that contain fields (see: <<fields>>) will be able to take in multiple
entry of each field (except `sort` which only allows one field).
* However, when multiple fields are inputted, eg. `c/Google c/Facebook`, only the last field will be recognised
by the application. In the example above, only `c/Facebook` will be registered, `c/Google`
will be ignored by the application.

==== Command availability

* Commands will work on both *main list* and *archival list*.
** The exceptions are: `Archive`, `Unarchive`, `Reminder`

==== Colored internship applications
* Some internship applications in the list may be colored green or red. This is what each color means:

** Internship applications colored green indicates that there is an upcoming application deadline or interviews for that internship application.
** Internship applications colored red indicates that the internship application's status is `ghosted` and you might want to take action to keep the list relevant.

* Partial words will be matched e.g. `find a/Singapore` will match internship application with address field named `Singapores`.
* Consecutive find command calls will not stack on the resulting list from the preceding find command. It is always performed on either the main list or archival list (shown on the bottom left of the program window).
