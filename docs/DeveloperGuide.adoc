== Introduction

This developer guide is written for software developers or designers who wish to contribute to the project. However, you may also use it if
you wish to gain deeper insight into the system design and implementation of *Internship Diary*.

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/diary/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/diary/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/diary/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `InternshipApplicationListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/diary/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/diary/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `InternshipDiaryParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an internship application).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("select 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `select 1` Command
image::SelectSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `SelectCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/diary/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Internship Diary data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<InternshipApplication>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Status` list in `Internship Diary`, which `Internship Application` can reference. This would allow `Internship Diary` to only require one `Status` object per unique `Status`, instead of each `Internship Application` needing their own `Status` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/diary/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in JSON format and read it back.
* can save the `InternshipDiary` data in JSON format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.diary.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort command

The find command allows the user to sort the currently visible list of internship applications. The following sequence
diagram will illustrate the process of invocation for the command:

image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following subsections will go through the general implementations of the sort command.

==== Implementation
The find command is implemented in the class `SortCommand` and uses the `SortCommandParser` class to parse the
arguments for the command.

To facilitate the sort command, several comparator classes implementing `Comparator<InternshipApplication>` are used:

* `ApplicationDateComparator` -- Comparator to compare internship applications by their `ApplicationDate` field
in chronological order.
* `CompanyComparator` -- Comparator to compare internship applications by their `Company` field
in lexicographical order.
* `PriorityComparator` -- Comparator to compare internship applications by their `Priority` field
in ascending order.
* `RoleComparator` -- Comparator to compare internship applications by their `Role` field
in lexicographical order.
* `StatusComparator` -- Comparator to compare internship applications by their `Status` field
by the order which they are declared in the Status Enum class.

The `SortCommandParser` looks for a acceptable prefix in the command, and passes the corresponding comparator to `SortCommand`.
If the number of such prefixes found is not exactly one, `SortCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`.

==== Reverse sort

This version of the command is invoked when the user enters the command with `reverse` as the
preamble text in the parameter, e.g. `sort reverse c/`. After retrieving the correct `comparator` to use,
the parser would pass `comparator.reversed()` to the constructor of `SortCommand` instead of `comparator`.
This would reverse the order in which the currently visible list of internship applications is sorted in.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to sort by multiple fields
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Accept only one field to sort by when using SortCommand.
This works as the list uses stable sort.
** Pros: More streamlined, less complex. +
`EnteredCommandsHistory` allows the user to get the sort command template back
in just one press of the up arrow key so there is little hassle. +
Users do not have to remember the order to place the arguments to get the sort they want.
** Cons: Hard to explain the concept of stable sort in the User Guide.

* **Alternative 2**: Allow multiple fields to sort by.
** Pros: Two less key presses.
** Cons: Code becomes much more complex. +
Users has to remember the order to place the arguments to get the sort they want. +
Users are highly unlikely to use this feature, as sorting one field by one feels more natural. +
Harder to implement reverse sorting.
// end::sort[]

// tag::clear[]
=== Clear command

The clear command allows the user to delete all internship applications. The following sequence
diagram will illustrate the process of invocation for the command:

image::ClearSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following subsections will go through the general implementations of the clear command.

==== Implementation
The find command is implemented in the class `InitClearCommand`, `ClearCommand` and uses the
`ClearCommandConfirmationParser` class to parse the arguments for the command.

The implementation for this command is unique as it causes 'LogicManager' to use `ClearCommandConfirmationParser`,
which is a subclass of `InternshipDiaryParser`, as the main parser to parse the next user input.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to prompt for confirmation.
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Implement an abstract method `getNextParser` for all commands.
** Pros: Easy to extend. +
New commands which require a prompt or alternative parsing do not need to further
modify the `InternshipDiaryParser` or `LogicManager` class.
** Cons: All commands will have to implement a `getNextParser` method. As `getNextParser` returns `null` for most
commands, an abstract class is used. However, this means that commands cannot extend other abstract classes in
the future.

* **Alternative 2**: Have `InternshipDiaryParser` have different modes depending
on what command was last executed.
** Pros: Simple to understand.
** Cons: `InternshipDiaryParser` has no access to the next mode the command leads into, `LogicManager`
needs to pass it into `InternshipDiaryParser`. +
As the different modes do not share code, they are better off as separate classes.

* **Alternative 3**: Make a confirmation window which freeze the main window.
** Pros: The `InternshipDiaryParser` or `LogicManager` class may not need to be modified.
** Cons: Relies on global static methods which may lead to bugs in the future.
// end::clear[]

// tag::interview[]
=== Interview and Interview Commands
==== Implementation
The implementation of interviews will be facilitated by two overarching components, the Model Class `Interview`
which is associated to an `InternshipApplication` (see Model Diagram <<Design-Model>> ) and the Logic Classes `InterviewCommandParser` and `InterviewCommand`.

The class diagram below shows the classes associated to `Interview`. `Interview` will consist of the following variables:

* `boolean` isOnline -- indicates whether the interview is online.
* `ApplicationDate` interviewDate -- indicates the date of the interview.
* `Address` interviewAddress -- indicates the address of the interview.

In particular, `Interview` will rely on the `ApplicationDate` and `Address` classes in the Model to implement `interviewDate` and `interviewAddress`

image::InterviewClassDiagram.png[]

Interviews can only be modified through the `interview` command which relies upon `InterviewCommandParser` and `InterviewCommand` classes.
The `interview` command will encompass four types of sub-command: `add list edit delete`. Correspondingly, the `InterviewCommand`
class will be made abstract with specific implementation of each sub-command in an inheriting class, this can be seen in the diagram below.

image::InterviewCommandClassDiagram.png[]

Additionally, `InterviewCommand` will implement the `InterviewCommand#getInternshipApplication(Model, Index)` operation.
This is to facilitate all sub-commands to acquire the `InternshipApplication` to modify the `Interview` from.

`InterviewCommandParser` is the entry point to all `interview` sub-command. It will be invoked from `InternshipDiaryParser`
which is the primary logic parser for user input. The following sequence diagram will illustrate the process of invocation for
 `InterviewAddCommand`. All other sub-commands will follow the same invocation format.

image::InterviewCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to implement different interview commands
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Use a standardized command with sub-command type parsed as user input.
** Pros: More streamlined, only one command. +
Able to use polymorphism to share operations between commands.
** Cons: Harder to implement and document.

* **Alternative 2**: Use separate commands for each different method of modifying interview.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Makes the user remember more commands. +
Create a lot of repetition in code.
// end::interview[]

// tag::find[]
=== Find command

The find command allows the user to get a filtered list of internship applications. The following sequence
diagram will illustrate the process of invocation for the command:

image::FindSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following subsections will go through the general implementations of the find command, as well as the 2
versions of the command, find any match, and find match by fields.

==== Implementation
The find command is implemented in the class `FindCommand` and uses the `FindCommandParser` class to parse the
arguments for the command.

To facilitate the find command, several predicates classes implementing `Predicate<InternshipApplication>` are used:

* `CompanyContainsKeywordsPredicate` -- Predicate to check if an internship application's `Company` field contains any
substring matching any words in the list supplied by its constructor `CompanyContainsKeywordsPredicate(List<String>
keywords)`.
* `RoleContainsKeywordsPredicate` -- Predicate to check if an internship application's `Role` field contains any
substring matching any words in the list supplied by its constructor `RoleContainsKeywordsPredicate(List<String>
keywords)`.
* `AddressContainsKeywordsPredicate` -- Predicate to check if an internship application's `Address` field contains any
substring matching any words in the list supplied by its constructor `AddressContainsKeywordsPredicate(List<String>
keywords)`.
* `PhoneContainsNumbersPredicate` -- Predicate to check if an internship application's `Phone` field contains any
substring matching any words in the list supplied by its constructor `PhoneContainsNumbersPredicate(List<String>
numbers)`.
* `EmailContainsKeywordsPredicate` -- Predicate to check if an internship application's `Email` field contains any
substring matching any words in the list supplied by its constructor `EmailContainsKeywordsPredicate(List<String>
keywords)`.
* `PriorityContainsNumbersPredicate` -- Predicate to check if an internship application's `Phone` field contains any
substring matching any words in the list supplied by its constructor `PriorityContainsNumbersPredicate(List<String>
numbers)`..
* `ApplicationDateIsDatePredicate` -- Predicate to check if an internship application's `ApplicationDate` field is
exactly the date supplied by its constructor `ApplicationDateIsDatePredicate(LocalDate date)`.
* `StatusContainsKeywordsPredicate` -- Predicate to check if an internship application's `Status` field contains any
substring matching any words in the list supplied by its constructor `StatusContainsKeywordsPredicate(List<String>
keywords)`.

==== Find Any Match

This version of the command is invoked when the user enters the command with preamble text in the parameter, e.g.
`find google facebook` or `find google r/software`. The command will perform search for any internship application
where any of the fields `Company`, `Role`, `Address`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Priority` or `Status` contains a substring
matching at least one word in the preamble and display them, e.g. `find google facebook` will look for internship
applications whose any of the above fields contains the substring `google` or `facebook`.

The searching and displaying of the internship application is done by performing an `OR` operation on all the predicates
`CompanyContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `RoleContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `AddressContainsKeywordsPredicate`,
`PhoneContainsNumbersPredicate`, `EmailContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `PriorityContainsNumbersPredicate` and
`StatusContainsKeywordsPredicate` to get a single predicate and passing that into the method
`updateFilteredInternshipApplicationList()` of the `ModelManager` instance.

==== Find Match by Fields

This version of the command is invoked when the user enters the command without any preamble text in the parameter, e.g.
`find c/google r/software`. The command will perform a search for any internship application where the fields
`Company`, `Role`, `Address`, `Phone`, `Email`, `ApplicationDate`, `Priority` and `Status` match any of the supplied
word after their respective prefixes (if a field's prefix is not specified, the field is not checked),
e.g. `find c/google facebook d/01 02 2020` will look for internship applications where the `Company` field contains
a substring `google` or `facebook` and the `ApplicationDate` field matching the date 1st February 2020.

The searching and displaying of the internship application is done by performing an `AND` operation on the
required predicates that is any of `CompanyContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `RoleContainsKeywordsPredicate`,
`AddressContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `PhoneContainsNumbersPredicate`, `EmailContainsKeywordsPredicate`,
`ApplicationDateIsDatePredicate`, `PriorityContainsNumbersPredicate` and `StatusContainsKeywordsPredicate` to get a
single predicate and passing that into the method `updateFilteredInternshipApplicationList()` of the `ModelManager`
instance.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to implement the different versions of find command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Use a standardized command with the version to invoke determined by the type of
user input parameters.
** Pros: More streamlined, only one command. +
This ensures that the user dont have to remember multiple command to use the different versions.
** Cons: Longer and less specific execute method.

* **Alternative 2**: Use separate commands for the different versions of find.
** Pros: More specific execute method for each of the command.
** Cons: Makes the user remember more commands.

* **Alternative 3**: Use the first word of the user input parameter to select which version of find command to invoke.
** Pros: Slightly more streamlined than multiple commands. +
This still requires user to remember the right words to invoke the different versions.
** Cons: Longer and less specific execution method.
// end::find[]

// tag::archival[]
=== Archival System

This feature allows users to store chosen internship application(s) into the archival.

The entire system is driven by two mechanisms:

. the ability to switch views between the archived and unarchived list of internship application(s)
. the ability to move internship application(s) into the archived list and vice-versa

The two mechanisms can be further broken down into the following four commands: `list`, `archival`, `archive`, and `unarchive`.

==== List & Archival

To handle the ability for a user to switch views, we implemented the commands `list` and `archival`:

* `list` allows the user to view the unarchived internship application(s)
* `archival` allows the user to view the archived internship application(s)

From here on, we will refer to the list of unarchived internship application(s) as the *main list*, and the list of
archived internship application(s) as the *archival list*.

Beyond the primary purpose of allowing users to switch between their view of main and archived list of internship application(s),
`list` and `archival` also helps to verify that the `archive` and `unarchive` commands are used appropriately.

This means that a user should not `archive` an internship application when it is already in the archival -- doing so will raise an exception.
This is identical for the `unarchive` command in the main list as well.

===== Implementation

The class diagram below depicts the important methods and variables that provide us the ability to switch
views between the main list and the archival list.

image::InternshipDiaryAndModelManagerClassDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

The object diagram below illustrates the three `UniqueInternshipApplicationList` objects maintained by `InternshipDiary`:

* `displayedInternships`
* `archivedInternships`
* `unarchivedInternships`

image::InternshipDiaryAndModelManagerObjectDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

As the name suggests, `displayedInternships` is the list that is shown to the user in the GUI. It references either
`archivedInternships` or `unarchivedInternships` at any one time.

When a user is viewing the main list, `displayedInternships` references `unarchivedInternships`.
And when a user is viewing the archival list, `displayedInternships` references `archivedInternships`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how an `archival` command is executed. The `list` command is similar to `archival`.
You may use the same sequence diagram for the `list` command.

image::ArchivalSequenceDiagram.png[align="center"]

The following code snippet is retrieved from the InternshipDiary class. It illustrates the internal workings of how we switch the view between the archived list and the main list.

    public void viewArchivedInternshipApplicationList() {
        this.displayedInternships = archivedInternships;
        this.currentView = InternshipApplicationViewType.ARCHIVED;
        firePropertyChange(DISPLAYED_INTERNSHIPS, getDisplayedInternshipList());
    }

It can be seen explicitly from the code snippet that we make use of referencing to switch between the views of archived and main list.
However, such implementation brings about issues with reactivity -- where elements that reference `displayedInternships` will not be aware of the
reference update in `displayedInternships` whenever the user executes `archival` or `list`. Therefore, in the above scenario, users would still see the main list after executing the `archival` command.

In order to resolve this issue, we need to employ the observer pattern. The idea is to assign each UI element to be an *observer* and `InternshipDiary` to be the *observable*.
Consequently, whenever there is a state change to `InternshipDiary`, the list of observers will be notified and updated automatically.

To achieve this observer pattern, we made use of the `PropertyChangeSupport` class and the `PropertyChangeListener` interface.
`PropertyChangeSupport` is a utility class to support the observer pattern by managing a list of listeners (observers) and firing `PropertyChangeEvent` to
the listeners. A class that contains an instance of `PropertyChangeSupport` is an observable. On the other hand, a class
that implements the `PropertyChangeListener` interface is an observer.

image::InternshipDiaryAndModelManagerPropertyChangeClassDiagram.png[align="center"]

The class diagram above showcases our implementation of a two-tier observer-observable structure: +

* `InternshipDiary` is an observable
* `ModelManager` is both an observable and observer
** It observes any changes to `displayedInternships` contained in `InternshipDiary`
* `StatisticsWindow` is an observer
** It observes any changes to `filteredInternshipApplications` contained in `ModelManager`

[NOTE]
====
* `InternshipDiary` and `ModelManager` each contains an instance of `PropertyChangeSupport`.
* `ModelManager` serves as an abstraction between `StatisticsWindow` and `InternshipDiary`.
* All the UI elements in our implementation follow the above class diagram -- `StatisticsWindow` just happens to be the UI element that we chose to illustrate our diagram.
====

We will briefly discuss how the observer pattern works in our implementation.

Whenever an object wants to observe changes in another object, it will call the `addPropertyChangeListener` function
of the `PropertyChangeSupport` instance from the appropriate object that it wishes to observe. It will also have to specify which property
of that object it wants to observe.

In our case, when ModelManager is created, it will call the `addPropertyChangeListener` function of the `PropertyChangeSupport` instance
belonging to `InternshipDiary`. The function call will look like this: `addPropertyChangeListener("displayedInternships", this)` where `this`
is a reference to `ModelManager` itself (so that it can be registered as a listener of the `displayedInternships` property).

The process is similar for any UI element that wants to observe the `filteredInternshipApplications` property of `ModelManager`.

As a result, whenever there is a change to the property `displayedInternships` in `InternshipDiary`, the `PropertyChangeSupport` instance of
`InternshipDiary` will call `firePropertyChange` to emit a `PropertyChangeEvent` to `ModelManager`. The emitted event will trigger the
`propertyChange` function of `ModelManager`. `ModelManager` can then retrieve the new reference from the event and update its
`filteredInternshipApplications` accordingly. It will then repeat the event emission process to any UI element (e.g. StatisticsWindow) that is observing the
`filteredInternshipApplications` property.

====
[NOTE]
The two-tier observer-observable structure is *necessary*. This is because `list` and `archival` only changes the reference of `displayedInternships`. +

When 'ModelManager' updates its property `filteredInternshipApplications` with the new reference, UI elements that reference `filteredInternshipApplications`
will not be aware of the reference update to `filteredInternshipApplications`. Thus, `ModelManager` has to notify and update the UI elements as well.
====

As an extension, our team also implemented enumeration for each property that is being observed. This modification ensures type safety and a way for us
to track what properties are observed. This is especially important when many properties are being observed.

Below is the updated class diagram with the implementation of `ListenerPropertyType` enumeration.

image::InternshipDiaryAndModelManagerPropertyChangeEnumClassDiagram.png[align="center"]

As seen from the diagram above, each observable will implement two additional methods to use `ListenerPropertyType` enumeration as parameters:

. `addPropertyChangeListener(ListenerPropertyType propertyType, PropertyChangeListener l)`
. `firePropertyChange(ListenerPropertyType propertyType, Object newValue)`

This forms a layer of abstraction as users would not be allowed to call the the `addPropertyChangeListener` and `firePropertyChange` methods of
`PropertyChangeSupport` directly.

===== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to implement the Archival system on the backend
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Maintain three `UniqueInternshipApplicationList`: `displayedInternships`, `unarchivedInternships`, and `archivedInternships`.
`displayedInternships` will be used as the reference for other elements to retrieve the list of internship application(s) for usage.
Whenever the user executes `archival`, we will update the reference of `displayedInternships` to `archivedInternships` and vice-versa.
In terms of storage, we will use only one list. This means that whenever we load the list of internship application(s) from the JSON save file,
we will filter the internship application(s) appropriately into `archivedInternships` and `unarchivedInternships` in `InternshipDiary`.
When saving, we will combine both `archivedInternships` and `unarchivedInternships` into a single list for storage.
** Pros: No need to modify the storage and its relevant test cases. This provides stability in the refactoring process.
** Cons: Potentially expensive in terms of computation. Furthermore, we will have to implement observer pattern to handle the reference changes.

* **Alternative 2**: Manipulate the current view of the internship application list by using Predicate and FilteredList,
along with the boolean isArchived variable in `InternshipApplication`. This will easily help us determine which internship application should be rendered.
** Pros: Very easy to implement and less expensive in terms of memory and computation. No need to implement observer pattern as there will be no reference updates.
** Cons: Potentially unsustainable as conflicts are likely to arise with commands that make heavy use of predicates (e.g. `Find` command).

===== Aspect: How to implement the Observer Pattern
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Use `PropertyChangeSupport` class and `PropertyChangeListener` interface from the `java.beans` package to support our implementation.
** Pros: Easy and intuitive to use. Good built-in support. Seems to be highly recommended by other users.
** Cons: Seemingly negligible for our usage.
* **Alternative 2**: Use Java's `Observable` class and `Observer` interface.
** Pros: Seemingly negligible for our usage.
** Cons: The package is deprecated. Harder to understand and implement.

==== Archive & Unarchive

To allow users to move internship application(s) between the main and archival list of internship application(s),
we implemented the commands `archive` and `unarchive`:

* `archive` allows a user to move internship application(s) from the main list to the archival list.
* `unarchive` allows a user to move internship application(s) from the archival list to the main list.

The following activity diagram depicts the behaviour of an `archive` command. You may use it as a reference for `unarchive` as well. The activity diagrams for both are very similar.

image::ActivityDiagramArchiveCommand.png[align="center", width="700"]

While implementing the `archive` and `unarchive` commands, we realised that users may sometimes want to cherry-pick multiple internship application(s) to execute on or mass-execute on certain types of internship application(s).
For example, a user may want to archive all the internship application(s) that have the status of "rejected".

Commands like `archive`, `unarchive`, and `delete` can be seen as *removal-based commands*. This is because the utility
of such functions are very similar; in that they serve to modify the list by removing items.

Therefore, we specifically created a new class, `RemovalBasedCommand`, to extend the functionality of *removal-based commands* like `archive`, `unarchive`, and `delete`.
Through this new class, users will be able to execute the commands on multiple internship applications.

===== Implementation

Users are able to execute removal-based commands like `archive` according to the execution types we have in the enumeration class `RemovalBasedCommandExecutionType`.

We have implemented the following execution types: `BY_INDEX`, `BY_INDICES`, and `BY_FIELD`. For the execution type `BY_FIELD`, users can only
execute by the `Status` field of an internship application currently.

====
The format of a removal-based command can take on any of the following forms:

. `command` INDEX
. `command` INDEX, [INDEX], [INDEX], ... +
(where INDEX within the bracket is optional and there can only be as many INDEX as the number of internship application(s) displayed)
. `command` s/STATUS +
(where STATUS refers to a valid internship application status)

Note that `command` can be any one of the removal-based commands.
====

It is important to note that each execution type works similarly. At the core, all of them involves retrieving the index of a internship application to execute on.
The difference lies in the pre-processing stage -- the steps an execution type takes to retrieve all the required indices.

Therefore, to ensure succinctness, we will only be illustrating the usage of the command `archive` with the execution type `BY_FIELD`.
Other variations of *removal-based commands* and *execution types* are similar.

The following sequence diagram provides a high-level overview of how the `archive` command with the execution type of `BY_FIELD` is executed in our application.

image::ArchiveSequenceDiagram.png[align="center"]

As illustrated in the diagram above, the pre-processing steps of `BY_FIELD` involves applying the appropriate predicate to filter the
internship applications and then converting these internship applications to their respective index.
This provides us with required indices that we will execute the removal-based command on.

====
[NOTE]
We have implemented the mechanism to be reusable and extensible for new commands and execution types.

This is evident in the sequence diagram above, where the different kinds of *removal-based commands* are abstracted from the diagram and
referred to simply as `RemovalBasedCommand`. This means that the above diagram is applicable to `archive`, `unarchive`, `delete`, and any other
*removal-based commands* that we may wish to introduce in the future.

Furthermore, if we ever wish to create a *new* `RemovalBasedCommandExecutionType` (on top of `BY_INDEX`, `BY_INDICES`, and `BY_FIELD`), we may simply
add a new alternative path to the diagram (or a new switch condition in terms of code).
====

The following sequence diagram captures how `RemovalBasedCommandExecuteTypeParser` parses the input and determines the *execution type* of the command.
It also shows how a `RemovalBasedCommand` is created with the appropriate `RemovalBasedCommandExecutionType` and command word.

image::RemovalBasedCommandExecutionTypeParserSequenceDiagram.png[align="center"]

As seen from the diagram above, the parser determined the execution type to be `BY_FIELD` and generated the appropriate predicate to
construct a `RemovalBasedCommand` instance.

Based on the command word passed in to construct the `RemovalBasedCommand` instance, `RemovalBasedCommand` creates a lazy lambda function
that can be called to construct the appropriate *removal-based command* for execution.

The following sequence diagram depicts the above behaviour.

image::GenerateLazyCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="500", align="center"]

As the command word is `archive`, a lazy lambda function to construct an `ArchiveCommand` is returned.

The following sequence diagram captures the process of executing the lazy removal-based command on one index.
This particular index allows us to retrieve the appropriate internship application.

image::ConstructAndExecuteLazyCommandByIndexSequenceDiagram.png[align="center", width="800"]

It can be seen that the previously-generated lazy command is executed in the above sequence diagram.

`ArchiveCommand` is constructed and subsequently executed on the index provided, by making the
appropriate function call to the model to execute on the internship application. In this case, `archiveInternshipApplication` is called.

The following sequence diagram captures the process of executing the lazy `ArchiveCommand` on indices.

image::ConstructAndExecuteLazyCommandByIndicesSequenceDiagram.png[width="500", align="center"]

As seen above, `executeLazyCommandOnIndices` merely reuses the function `executeLazyCommandOnIndex` (from the previous sequence diagram)
by running it on every index provided. The feedback from each execution is cumulatively concatenated to form a single feedback.

The following sequence diagram captures the process of re-creating the command result in `RemovalBasedCommand` by
using the feedback obtained from the specific command execution, which is `ArchiveCommand` in our example.

image::CreateCommandResultSequenceDiagram.png[width="500", align="center"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to implement multiple execution types for removal-based commands
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Use encapsulation to hold the appropriate command word, which will then be used to
generate the removal-based command that will execute based on the execute type provided.
`RemovalBasedCommand` will store the command word of the appropriate removal-based command and create the command when
`RemovalBasedCommand` is executed. This removal-based command will then be used on the index/indices provided according to the execution type.
** Pros: Easier to implement and convey the idea to team members.
** Cons: Will require multiple case handlings (e.g. switch cases). Polymorphism may be a better solution in terms of code extensibility and elegance.

* **Alternative 2**: Use polymorphism where each removal-based command extends the class `RemovalBasedCommand` and inherit the appropriate execution type methods. +
** Pros: Code will likely be more extensible and elegant.
** Cons: Likely to require major redesigning and refactoring of existing logic codebase because we will have to modify `Command` class.
Furthermore, the changes may affect areas that we may not have considered. This is risky and will take a lot of time, effort, and team discussion.

// tag::statistics[]
=== Statistics Feature

This feature allows users to view relevant metrics about their internship application(s).

Currently, the tracked metrics include:

* the amount of internship applications in each status
* the percentage of internship applications in each status

==== Implementation

The following class diagram gives an overview of our implementation of the statistics feature.

image::StatisticsClassDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

Users will be able to view the metrics from two areas:

. `StatisticsBarFooter`
.. found at the bottom of the application in the form of a bar footer
.. serves as a quick view of the metrics in terms of counters
. `StatisticsWindow`
.. displayed on a separate window that is opened upon the command `stats`
.. serves as an additional graphical statistics interface for users to get a visual breakdown of the metrics +
(currently in the form of a bar chart and a pie chart)

The `Statistics` object is used to generate statistics for any internship application list that it is given.
`StatisticsWindow` and `StatisticsBarFooter` each contains an instance of `Statistics` that helps them compute the relevant statistics
whenever there is any update to the internship application list.

The internship application list can be updated either due to a change in reference in `displayedInternships` from `InternshipDiary` (e.g. `archival` and `list`) or any modifications to the
current internship application list (e.g. adding, deleting, editing of internship applications).

The following activity diagram illustrates how `StatisticsWindow` (`StatisticsBarFooter` shares the same workflow) is notified of the updates
in the internship application list and how it subsequently updates the statistics.

image::ActivityDiagramStatistics.png[width="700", align="center"]

Upon creation of the `StatisticsWindow` and `StatisticsBarFooter`, each of them will attach an event listener to the internship application list
that it was given. This event listener will notify them of any internal modifications to the internship application list.

On the other hand, both `StatisticsWindow` and `StatisticsBarFooter` will register themselves as *observers* as well. This is so that
the implemented observer pattern can notify them of any changes in the internship application list reference and update them with the new reference
accordingly.

Any of the two updates above will trigger the `Statistics` to recompute with the updated internship application list.
`StatisticsWindow` and `StatisticsBarFooter` will then retrieve the required computed metrics from `Statistics` and re-binds the
them to the UI accordingly.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Which list to retrieve data from to generate statistics
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Use filtered ObservableList. The filtered list is dynamically updated by `find` and `sort` command.
The statistics model will generate statistics based on the dynamic filtering changes that occur in either the main list or archival list (the current view selected by user).
** Pros: Users will be choose which list they want to view the relevant statistics for.
Works well with `archival`, `list`, and `find` commands that dynamically changes the list.
** Cons: Often re-computation upon changes in the filtered list may cause some performance bottleneck.

* **Alternative 2**: Use the base list that contains all of the internship application(s). The base list is not filtered according to predicate(s) set by users.
** Pros: Require less re-computation compared to using filtered ObservableList, as it only recomputes upon addition(s), deletion(s), or changes
in an internship application stored in the list.
** Cons: May be unintuitive to some extent for users when the statistics do not tally with the current view of the list.

===== Aspect: How to store the statistics generated from data
A list of internship application(s) will be passed into the statistics model and upon function call,
the statistics model will iterate through the list and generate/update the latest statistics accordingly.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Store the mapping between each status and count using a HashMap.
The idea is to retrieve all the statuses available from the enum (whenever the statistics model is created)
and create a HashMap with those status as the key and respective count as the value.
** Pros: Extensible and reusable. Regardless of any changes, this system can dynamically handle the addition, deletion, or changes in statuses.
** Cons: Seemingly negligible cons for our usage.

* **Alternative 2**: Store each status count in separate variables that are initialized upon the creation of statistics model.
** Pros: Straightforward and very easy to understand for future developers.
** Cons: Very inextensible.
// end::statistics[]

// tag::reminder[]
=== Reminder Command

The reminder command displays to users a list of internship applications which:

* have status `wishlist` and need to be submitted in 7 days
* have status `interview` and interviews scheduled in 7 days

The following sequence diagram shows how the command is executed:

.Sequence Diagram of `ReminderCommand`
image::ReminderSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation
The reminder command is implemented in the class `ReminderCommand`.

To facilitate the reminder command, several predicates classes implementing `Predicate<InternshipApplication>` are used:

* `ApplicationDateDuePredicate` -- Predicate to check whether the `ApplicationDate` field of an internship application
has a date of the current date or within 7 days of the current date.

* `StatusIsWishlistPredicate` -- Predicate to check whether the `Status` field of an internship application is
`wishlist`.

* `InterviewDateDuePredicate` -- Predicate to check whether there is at least one interview in the `ArrayList<Interview>
interviews` of an internship application that has a date of the current date or within 7 days from the current date.

* `StatusIsInterviewPredicate` -- Predicate to check whether the `Status` field of an internship application is
`interview`.

* `IsNotArchivedPredicate` -- Predicate to check whether an internship application is not archived.

Firstly, an `AND` operation on the `ApplicationDateDuePredicate` and `StatusIsWishlistPredicate` as well as another
`AND` operation on the `InterviewDateDuePredicate` and  `StatusIsInterviewPredicate` are performed. Next, an `OR`
operation is performed on the predicates from the previous two `AND` operations. An 'AND' operation is then performed on
the predicate obtained from the previous `OR` operation and the `IsNotArchivedPredicate`. The final predicate produced is
then passed into the method `updateFilteredInternshipApplicationList()` of the `ModelManager` instance.

A comparator `ApplicationDateAndInterviewDateComparator` implementing `Comparator<InternshipApplication>` is also
passed into the method `updateFilteredInternshipApplicationList()` of the `ModelManager` instance to sort internship
applications in terms of which application is more urgent. It compares internship applications by their
`ApplicationDate` field as well as the earliest interview date in the `ArrayList<Interview> interviews` of the
applications, in order of either date being closer to current date. If two internship applications have the same date
in their `ApplicationDate` field, it compares them by the earliest interview date in the `ArrayList<Interview>
interviews` of the applications in order of which application has an interview that comes first.

==== Design considerations

====== Aspect: The order to display the internship applications
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Display the internship applications in the order of either their `ApplicationDate`
or `interviewDate` of the earliest interview scheduled in `ArrayList<Interview> interviews` is closer to current date.

** Pros: More useful to the user as the user can directly know which internship application to focus on more, regardless
of whether it is to prepare for the submission of the application, or to prepare for an interview scheduled.
** Cons: Longer code.

* **Alternative 2**: Display the internship applications in the order of which application's `ApplicationDate` is closer
to current date.

** Pros: Cleaner code.
** Cons: Has the assumption that an internship application with a earlier `ApplicationDate` will have an interview
scheduled at an earlier `interviewDate` as compared to an application with later `ApplicationDate`. User might miss out
on a earlier `interviewDate` for an application with later `ApplicationDate` and additional commands have to be typed in
to check `interviewDate`.
// end::reminder[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
