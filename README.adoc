* My Internship Diary is a desktop internship tracking application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* This app is aimed towards internship seekers, especially but not limited to university students.
* As internship seekers send many applications to many different sites and companies, it may be hard or troublesome to keep track of all these internship applications.
* My Internship Diary promises to simplify the process of tracking internships so that students will be able to concentrate completely on just landing that internship!
